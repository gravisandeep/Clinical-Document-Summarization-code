with\\nCAD, PVD who had difficulty speaking after left carotid\\nendarterectomy in [**2133-2-16**].  The patient has had bilateral\\ncarotid stenosis.  On [**2-21**] while he was sitting in a chair he\\ndeveloped sudden onset of right arm and leg numbness,\\nfollowed by right arm and leg weakness.  He also had\\ndifficulty speaking.  He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **]\\nand underwent a left carotid endarterectomy on [**2-26**] and\\nafterwards began having severe left sided headache behind his\\nleft eye that lasted for hours and was constant.\\nNevertheless, he visited [**Hospital3 **] for continued\\nheadaches and nausea and vomiting.  During one of those\\nvisits he had a contortion of his right face and bilateral\\narm jerking and was started on Dilantin with presumptive\\ndiagnosis of seizures.  He has recovered from that event when\\nwas again discharged home.  On [**3-13**] he again presented with\\npersistent headaches, confusion and inability to talk.  He\\nhad difficulty getting his words out.  He had a head CT at\\n[**Hospital3 **] which showed a linear hyperintense region\\nin the left central temporal lobe but also other lesions in\\nthe left posterior parietal lobes.  At that time he was\\ntransferred to the [**Hospital1 69**].  MRI\\nof his head showed left MCA/ACA and left MCA/PCA watershed\\nstrokes with acute and subacute hemorrhage conversions.  It\\nwas thought at that time that he had extended his watershed\\ninfarcts after carotid endarterectomy leading to a carotid\\nhyperperfusion syndrome.  The patient was discharged from the\\nneurologic Intensive Care Unit to a rehab facility.  On\\nThursday, [**2133-3-26**], patient's wife noticed erythema on\\npatient's face.  On [**3-27**] the visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) 8706**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11282**] of\\na rash on his arms as well.  The patient was noted to be\\nfebrile and was admitted to the [**Company 191**] Firm.

The patient works as a\\ncarpenter.\\n\\nFAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.3, pulse\\n86, blood pressure 94/65, respiratory rate 18, saturations\\n96% on room air.  In general, alert, oriented times three, no\\napparent distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and\\nreactive to light, mucus membranes moist, oropharynx clear.\\nNo lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm,\\nno murmurs.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen soft, nontender, non distended, positive bowel\\nsounds.  Extremities, no cyanosis, erythema, edema.  Neuro,\\ncranial nerves II through XII intact.  Skin red maculopapular\\nblanching erythema on face, torso and extremities, sparing\\nthe soles.  Bilateral lower extremity petechiae, no\\nsignificant oral lesions noted.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\\n1.  Derm:  Over the course of patient's stay on [**Company 191**] Firm,\\npatient had rigors and fevers of up to 101 degree.  The\\npatient was initially continued on Tegretol.  The patient had\\nworsening rash throughout his torso with lip swelling and\\ntongue swelling.  The patient did not experience any\\nrespiratory difficulties throughout the course of his stay on\\nthe [**Company 191**] service.  A derm consult was obtained.  The\\ndermatology team recommended discontinuing Tegretol.  Their\\nthought was that the patient's symptoms were secondary to his\\nhypersensitivity to Dilantin.  The patient was treated\\nsymptomatically with IV fluids, Zantac, Benadryl and Synalar\\ncream.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive\\nCare Unit overnight for observation given risk of respiratory\\ndistress.  [**Hospital **] Medical Intensive Care Unit stay was\\nuneventful.  Skin biopsy was also consistent with\\nhypersensitivity reaction.  Over the course of patient's stay\\nin the hospital, patient's rash started to improve with\\ndecreasing erythema and edema.\\n\\n2.  Neuro:  Patient was seen by neurology service.  They\\nrecommended stopping all anti-epileptic medications since\\nthey thought that his symptoms were likely secondary to\\ncarotid reperfusion syndrome and anti-seizure medications are\\nnot necessarily beneficial under these circumstances.\\n\\n3.  GI:  Patient's LFTs were slightly elevated during his\\nadmission.  The patient's Lipitor was held due to increased\\nLFTs.  His increased LFTs were likely secondary to Dilantin.\\nPatient to follow-up with his PCP to make sure LFTs are\\ntrending down and before restarting Lipitor.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\\n1.  Dilantin hypersensitivity reaction.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg po bid, Zantac 150 mg\\npo bid, Synalar ointment, Eucerin cream.

She was en route to her normal dialysis session, and EMT took BP that was 80s/40s, brought to LCH ED for evaluation. Notably recently admitted to Santa Rosa on 9/10/2098 for hematemesis/hematochezia, but no intervention done. No report of recent GI bleeding. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn ED, initial BP in 80s/30s, got 1.5 liters of IV fluid, came up to 90s/50s. Also was on 4-5 liters of oxygen with sat 95%. Blood and urine cultures sent, Vancomycin and Cefepime given. Daughter was contacted, who states patient is definitely DNR/DNI and no invasive interventions are to be done (including central lines, surgery, etc.) Bedside ultrasounds revealed known pleural effusions, pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, and hypoechoic material in bladder suspicious for abscess/infection. CT abdomen done, was notable for bladder wall thickening potentially c/w cystitis, a new moderate sized pericardial effusion, and rectal wall thickening c/w proctitis. After CT, Foley placed with reported return of 400-500 cc of frank pus. Labs notable for K 5.0, BUN/Cr 39/4.02, WBC count 7.7. \\n\\n\\n\\nPatient seen in ED &#8211; BP 80s/40s, but arousable and able to answer simple questions. Denies any complaints, including pain, dyspnea, nausea, with one-word answers.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen daughter subsequently arrives, she confirms desire for no invasive procedures, lines, surgeries, or ICU level care. She does add that patient was at Levi Hospital two weeks ago, treated for &#8220;lung infection.&#8221; Uncertain of specifics. \\n\\n\\n\\nROS\\n\\n15-point ROS as above; limited by mental status. \\n\\n\\n\\nMEDICAL HISTORY\\n\\n1 &#8211; Recurrent GIB &#8211; s/p EGD/colo showing multiple duodenal/colonic polyps (12/2097)\\n, here with GI bleed in September, no workup pursued as thought to be major cardiac risk.\\n\\n2 &#8211; Colon Ca - Pt seen by surgery and is not a surgical candidate 2/2 multiple medical comorbidities.\\n\\n\\n3 &#8211; ESRD since 2096 (HD: M/W/F)\\n\\n\\n      -Access L brachiocephalic AVF\\n\\n     \\n-Presumed 2/2 longstanding DM\\n\\n\\n4 &#8211; DM2 &#8211; On SSI 2/2 frequent hypoglycemia episodes on long acting insulin\\n\\n\\n5 &#8211; Chronic decubitus ulcers presumed 2/2 immobility\\n\\n\\n6 &#8211; HTN\\n\\n\\n7 &#8211; CVA (12/2096) &#8211; c/b significant residual speech/cognitive deficits\\n\\n\\n8 &#8211; Gastroparesis &#8211; presumed 2/2 longstanding DM. s/p gastric emptying study 2/2098\\n\\n\\n9 - Cataracts\\n\\n\\n10 &#8211; history of NSTEMI per some prior notes\\n\\n\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: from discharge med list in September; have requested current med list from NGH. \\n\\nAmlodipine 10 MG PO QPM \\n\\nCholestyramine Resin Dried 4 GM PO BID (last dose: 09/14/98 09:00 am)\\n\\nHydralazine Hcl 50 MG PO Q6H (last dose: 09/14/98 12:40 am)\\n\\nIrbesartan (Avapro) 150 MG PO QD \\n\\nLabetalol Hcl 300 MG PO TID (last dose: 09/13/98 08:20 pm)\\n\\nSimvastatin 40 MG PO QPM (last dose: 09/13/98 08:00 pm)\\n\\nAlbuterol Nebulizer Solution 2.5 MG NEB Q6H prn\\n\\nCalcium Acetate ( 1 Gelcap=667 Mg) 667 MG PO TID (last dose: 09/14/98 12:30 pm)\\n\\nDocusate Sodium (Colace ) 100 MG PO TID (last dose: 09/14/98 12:30 pm)\\n\\nOmeprazole 40 MG PO QD (last dose: 09/14/98 09:00 am)\\n\\nPolyethylene Glycol (Miralax) 17 GM PO QD prn\\n\\nSennosides (Senna Tablets) 2 TAB PO BID prn\\n\\nSevelamer (Renagel) 400 MG PO AC (last dose: 09/14/98 12:30 pm)\\n\\nDivalproex Sodium (Depakote) 250 MG PO QHS \\n\\nInsulin Regular Inj SC AC (Sliding Scale) \\n\\nIf BS &lt;= 200 give 0 Units\\n\\nFor BS from 201 to 250 give 4 Units\\n\\nFor BS from 251 to 300 give 6 Units\\n\\nFor BS from 301 to 350 give 8 Units\\n\\nFor BS from 351 to 400 give 10 Units\\n\\nFor BS =&gt; 401 give 12 Units and call responding clinician\\n\\nDonepezil Hcl (Aricept) 5 MG PO QHS \\n\\nErythromycin Ethylsuccinate 200 Mg/5 Ml 200 MG PO AC \\n\\nNephrocaps 1 CAPSULE PO QD \\n\\nAcetylsalicylic Acid 81 MG PO QD \\n\\n\\n\\nALLERGIES:  \\n\\nNKDA\\n\\n\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY \\n(from past notes):\\nMother with breast cancer, father with lung cancer.
