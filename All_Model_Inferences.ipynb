He has been experiencing increasing dyspnea with exertion over the past 5 weeks.  He has especially noted this when he climbs stairs or walking up an incline.  He also notes this SOB when he is walking the golf course. He denies any chest pain or orthopnea, although he states that he has been experiencing some \"indigestion\" the past few days.  It usually occurs in the morning. He was given sublingual nitroglycerin and notes improvement in his symptoms  His Lasix dose was increased on 4/3/96 (from 80 mg to 120 mg).  This increase did help his symptoms a little, but he still felt his exercise capacity had decreased.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAn ECHO was done on 4/10 which was not significantly changed from 1/95.  His EF was 74%, mild MR, dilated LA, symmetric LV hypertrophy without any obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities and RVSP 43 mmHg.  \\n\\n\\n\\nA Sestamibi stress test was done on 5/19.  The patient exercised for 3 minutes 21 seconds reaching 84% of predicted HR.  His EKG had STD AVF, V4-V6.  The perfusion scans showed a moderate, reversible mid-distal anterior, septal and apical defect indicative of moderate ischemia.  LV function preserved.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was admitted electively today for further evaluation.

As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.  Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.  The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.  After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred.  It has been progressive over the last several months.  He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.  He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.  He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.\\n\\n\\n\\nPast medical history:\\n\\n   Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes.  \\n\\nHypertension.  \\n\\nHypercholesterolemia.  \\n\\nHyperhomocysteinemia.  \\n\\nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation.  \\n\\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy.  \\n\\nGout.  \\n\\nRenal insufficiency.  \\n\\nMild thrombocytopenia.\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent Medications:\\n\\n  atenolol 25 mg BID\\n\\n Coumadin; Dir: as directed\\n\\n Ecotrin 325 mg qd\\n\\n Lipitor 20 mg qd\\n\\n Lasix 120 mg qd\\n\\n folate 1 mg qd\\n\\n allopurinol 100 mg qd\\n\\n Ativan\\n\\n Proscar\\n\\n free text medications; Dir: Insulin\\n\\n Protonix\\n\\n\\n\\nAllergies:\\n\\nNo known drug allergy   or IV contrast dye.\\n\\n\\n\\nFamily history:\\n\\n   Positive for brother who is status post stent placement at the age of 78 and another brother with congestive heart failure.  There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial history:\\n\\n   The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065.  He does not drink alcohol.  He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.\\n\\n\\n\\nReview of systems:\\n\\n   Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.  He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.  He denies hematochezia.  He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis.  He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.  He denies dysuria or hematuria.  He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.\\n\\n\\n\\nPhysical examination:\\n\\n-Pulse:   55 and regular\\n\\n-BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position\\n\\n-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored\\n\\n-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline\\n\\n-Neck:   Thyroid is not palpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water\\n\\n-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  He does have low dullness in both bases\\n\\n-Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.  He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur\\n\\n-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses\\n\\n-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has no pedal edema.  He has no clubbing or cyanosis\\n\\n\\n\\nProcedures:\\n\\nTc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.  His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.  Peak blood pressure was 158/80.  He had no chest pain.  Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.  The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.\\n\\n\\n\\nEKG:\\n\\n    today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.\\n\\n\\n\\nSelected recent labs:\\n\\n Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096.\\n\\n\\n\\nAssessment and plan:\\n\\n   In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096. His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again. There are a number of factors involved here. He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled. I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath. He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura. He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO. He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension. He also has low platelets. The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia. It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation. He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time. Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile. He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well. My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this. He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done. I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization. I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia. Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization. Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.\\n\\n\\n\\nChanges to Medications this

His symptoms started on Tuesday afternoon, three days ago, while working in the yard.  He describes substernal chest pressure that waxes and wanes in intensity, but has been constant since its onset.  It does not radiate.  It was associated with &#8220;gurgling&#8221; like &#8220;loose phlegm&#8221; in his chest at its onset, but this has since resolved.  It was worse while sitting in the car or leaning forward or backward, but not with twisting.  He has not had any recent URI symptoms.  Tylenol helps take the edge off of his discomfort.  He has been measuring his BP at home, and over the past few days it has ranged to 190/102 averaging 170/80.  He reports compliance with his medications without recent changes.  He has had worsened dyspnea on exertion, stating that he could walk 1+ miles one week ago, but could only manage 1/4 mile today.  He sleeps on two pillows with no changes, and he denies LE edema.  His anginal equivalent includes jaw and neck pain and mild substernal chest pressure without radiation to his arms; he states his current symptoms are not consistent with his angina.  \n","\n","\n","\n","He called Dr. Upham, his cardiologist, and was told to increase his Lasix frequence to 20 mg BID.  He was encouraged to come to the SSH ED for his symptoms given his history of CAD (below).  On arrival, the vital signs were T 96.7, P 71, BP 166/81, RR 18, Sat 97% RA.  He had negative kiosk biomarkers and no EKG changes.  He received NTG x3 without much relief and ASA at home.  \n","\n","\n","\n","PAST CARDIOLOGICAL HISTORY\n","\n","- 1/07/05: SSCP (heaviness/squeezing) radiating to left arm/jaw with throat constriction (MSH); EKG: STD V3-V6, palpitations; CK peak 340, Troponin 7.8 (SSH) \n","\n","- 1/18/05: LHC (SSH): LAD mild, mLCX after OM1 severe, prox OM1 severe, mRCA severe, mild inferior hypokinesis, LVEF 50%, mLCX 2x12 mm Minivision, OM1 2x12 mm Minivision, mRCA 2.75x12 mm Minivision\n","\n","- 1/20/05: Echo (SSH): LA 44 LVIDd 47 PWT 11 IVS 11 LVEF 56%, ascending aorta 33 \n","\n","- 5/24/05: ETT (MSH): HR 75-142 (86% MPHR - on Toprol), BP 150/84-154/100, EKG: NSR, 8 minutes, no CP, no ischemia on stress\n","\n","- 9/07: ETT (Gordon Hospital): negative\n","\n","- 09/26/07: POD #2 s/p radical prostatectomy 8/10 CP at rest (mid sternal to neck/left shoulder with diaphoresis); called 911 to SSH ER: EKG TWI inferiorly\n","\n","- 09/26/07: Echo (SSH): LA 39, LVIDd 52, PWT 10, IVS 10, LVEF 40%, mild MR, AV leaflets thickened with thin mobile echo densities c/w Lamble&#8217;s excrescence, ascending aorta 34, WMA inferior/septal/anterior/apical territories, LVEF 40%, new WMA compared to 2/05\n","\n","- 09/29/07: Angio (SSH/Dr Ochoa): LM patent, LAD 40% prox at  D1, D1 50%, mLAD 85%, pOM2 30%, pOM3 30%, RCA (dominant) mRCA 70% at stent inlet, 95% mPDA, BMS PDA 2.25x12 mm, mLAD BMS 2.75x15 mm and 2.5x12 mm\n","\n","\n","\n","PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n","\n","CAD (as above)\n","\n","s/p radical prostatectomy (10/07)\n","\n","s/p RML resection for carcinoid tumor (2096)\n","\n","s/p bleomycin rx (2085) and xrt (2084) for Hodgkins' disease\n","\n","DM2\n","\n","HTN\n","\n","GERD\n","\n","s/p appendectomy (2061)\n","\n","s/p knee surgery (2069)\n","\n","\n","\n","MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION\n","\n","Acetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin )  325 MG PO QD\n","\n","Atorvastatin (Lipitor )  80 MG PO QD\n","\n","Glyburide  5 MG PO BID BEFORE BREAKFAST AND BEFORE SUPPER\n","\n","Lisinopril  20 MG PO BID\n","\n","Metformin  1000 MG PO BID BEFORE BREAKFAST AND BEFORE SUPPER\n","\n","Nadolol  40 MG PO QD\n","\n","Omeprazole  20 MG PO QD\n","\n","Zolpidem Tartrate (Ambien)  5 MG PO QHS\n","\n","\n","\n","ALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS \n","\n","PCN &#8211; rash; Shellfish\n","\n","\n","\n","FAMILY HISTORY\n","\n","F &#8211; d, 87, MI (47), CABG x2\n","\n","M- d, 84 Parkinson&#8217;s disease, DM\n","\n","B &#8211; CABG x2, CHF (50s)\n","\n","\n","\n","SOCIAL HISTORY\n","\n","Lives in Kemmerer.

[CDATA [Record date: 2098-04-01 Mr. Fredrick is a 48-year-old man status post right middle lobectomy on September 24, 2096, for T1N0 carcinoid. He has had no complaints, since that time, and denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever. He has gained several pounds, but is otherwise feeling well. On physical exam today, the patient appears quite well. HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly. He has no palpable cervical, supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy. His blood pressure today is 130 / 88, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 89. S1 and S2 are within normal limits; and there is no murmur, rub or gallop. His resting O2 saturation is 100% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 20 per minute. His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 232 pounds. His chest is clear to auscultation and percussion, with good excursion and no change in tactile fremitus or egophony between the two hemithoraces. Abdominal examination is benign. I cannot appreciate any hepatosplenomegaly, and no other masses are identified. He has no tenderness to palpation. Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema. His incisions are well-healed, and no nodules are appreciated. The chest x-ray today is unchanged, with no evidence of new nodules, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. His recent chest CT scan shows several stable parenchymal nodules and no evidence of recurrent lymphoma or carcinoid. In summary, I am pleased to find Mr. Fredrick well, without evidence of recurrence. The plan is to see him for follow-up in four months. Larry T. Jansen, M.D. LTJ: lowery Larry T.
